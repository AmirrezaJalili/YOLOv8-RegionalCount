# YOLOv8-RegionalCount

YOLOv8-RegionalCount is a project that harnesses YOLO v8 for precise object counting in defined areas. It is ideal for various applications such as traffic analysis, retail insights, and environmental monitoring. This repository provides the code necessary to implement object counting using YOLOv8 in specific regions of interest.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient object detection.
- **Regional Counting**: Counts objects within user-defined regions of interest, enabling detailed analysis in specific areas.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for traffic analysis, retail insights (customer counting, product monitoring), environmental monitoring (animal tracking, waste detection), and more.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmirrezaJalili/YOLOv8-RegionalCount.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the YOLOv8 weights from the official source (provide link or instructions for downloading).

4. Place the downloaded weights in the `weights/` directory of this repository.

## Usage

1. Prepare your input data:

    - **Images/Video**: Place your images or videos for object detection in the `data/` directory.
    - **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition**: Define the regions of interest within your images or videos using annotation tools or manually. Annotations should be in a compatible format (provide details on format).

2. Run the object counting script:

    ```bash
    <>
    ```

    - Replace `<path_to_input_data>` with the path to your input images or videos.
    - Replace `<path_to_output_results>` with the desired output directory for counting results.

3. View the counting results:

    - Results will be saved in the specified output directory, providing detailed counts of objects within defined regions of interest.
